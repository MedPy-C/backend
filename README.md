# Backend
This repo serves as a portfolio of a backend project (work in progress...).

## Want to join us?
Do you want to contribute to this project?
Are you a junior frontend looking to create a project for your portfolio?
Maybe we can work together and generate teamwork experience.
Any framework will work, we just need to be able to connect the backend (REST API) with an interface.
